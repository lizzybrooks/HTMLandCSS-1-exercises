<button class="rightButton">1956 MIT's Whirlwind Computer</button>

<div class="MIT">
  <p>MIT's Whirlwind computer was a groundbreaking project that pioneered the development of real-time computer systems. Its development started in the 1940s and continued throughout the 1950s, led by a team of engineers and computer scientists at MIT, including Jay Forrester, Robert Everett, and Ken Olsen. The project began as part of a research effort to build a flight simulator for the US military. In order to build the simulator, the team needed to create a computer that could process data in real-time, allowing the pilot to experience a realistic simulation of flying a plane. The team at MIT developed a system that used a magnetic core memory, a technology that they invented and patented, which allowed the computer to operate much faster than other contemporary systems. In 1951, the Whirlwind I computer was unveiled, marking a major milestone in the development of real-time computing. It was the first computer to use magnetic core memory, which was a major advance over previous memory technologies. It was also one of the first computers to use transistors, which were much smaller and more reliable than vacuum tubes, the standard technology of the day. The Whirlwind project continued to evolve, with subsequent versions of the computer becoming more advanced and powerful. The Whirlwind II, which was completed in 1959, was the first computer to use magnetic tape storage, which allowed for even more data to be processed in real-time. The Whirlwind project had a significant impact on the development of modern computing. It set the stage for the creation of computer systems that could process data in real-time, which was critical for a wide range of applications, including scientific research, military operations, and commercial computing. In addition to its technical innovations, the Whirlwind project also had a major impact on the field of computer science. Many of the engineers and scientists who worked on the project went on to become leaders in the field, helping to shape the development of computing over the following decades. Today, the legacy of the Whirlwind project can be seen in the many real-time computing systems that are in use across a wide range of industries and applications. It remains an important milestone in the history of computing, and a testament to the power of innovation and collaboration in advancing human knowledge and progress.</p>

<button class="rightButton"> 1984 Apple Macintosh Commercial</button>

<div class="rightContent">
  <p>In 1984, Apple Computer Inc. launched the Macintosh personal computer with a highly anticipated commercial that aired during the Super Bowl XVIII, which was watched by millions of people. The commercial, which was directed by Ridley Scott, was titled "1984" and featured a dystopian, Orwellian world, inspired by George Orwell's novel "1984". The commercial showed a group of identical people sitting in a large auditorium, watching a screen showing a Big Brother-like figure addressing them. A woman, representing the Macintosh computer, then ran into the room and threw a sledgehammer at the screen, shattering it and freeing the people from their conformity. The commercial was widely praised for its production values, its use of imagery, and its powerful message of individuality and freedom. It was a bold move for Apple, as the company was relatively small at the time and was taking on much larger competitors such as IBM. The "1984" commercial is widely considered one of the most iconic ads in advertising history, and it helped establish the Macintosh as a groundbreaking product that was different from anything else on the market. It also demonstrated Apple's willingness to take risks and to think outside the box, which became part of the company's brand identity. </p>

<button class="rightButton">Alan Turing</button>

<div class="rightContent">
  <p>Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist who is considered one of the fathers of modern computing. He is best known for his work during World War II, when he helped crack German codes using a machine called the Bombe. He also proposed the concept of a universal computing machine, which laid the foundation for modern computers.</p>

<button class="leftButton">The Invention of the Transistor at Bell Telephone Laboratories</button>

<div class="leftContent">
  <p>The transistor is a semiconductor device that revolutionized the field of electronics and has become an essential component of modern technology. The invention of the transistor is credited to a team of scientists at Bell Telephone Laboratories, including John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley, who developed the first working transistor in December 1947.

    Prior to the invention of the transistor, electronic devices used vacuum tubes, which were bulky, inefficient, and prone to failure. The transistor was much smaller and more reliable, and it paved the way for the development of smaller and more sophisticated electronic devices, including the computer.
    
    The work of Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956, and the invention of the transistor is widely considered to be one of the most important technological breakthroughs of the 20th century..</p>

  <p>In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh computer with a groundbreaking Super Bowl commercial that has become iconic in advertising history. Directed by Ridley Scott, the one-minute spot depicted a dystopian world of conformity and control, inspired by George Orwell's novel "1984". The commercial showed a group of gray-suited people watching a screen in a bleak hall, with Big Brother delivering a monotonous message. A young woman, carrying a sledgehammer, runs into the hall and hurls the hammer at the screen, shattering it and freeing the audience from their conformity.</p>
  <p>The commercial was meant to introduce the Macintosh as a symbol of freedom and innovation, and it successfully captured the attention of the audience, generating buzz and excitement for the product. The ad only aired once during the Super Bowl, but it had a lasting impact on the public's perception of Apple and its products. The Macintosh became a popular computer, and Apple went on to become one of the most successful tech companies in the world.</p>
