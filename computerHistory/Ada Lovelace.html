    <div class="first-div"> Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was an English mathematician and writer,
      who is widely recognized as the world's first computer programmer. 
      She is best known for her work on Charles Babbage's early 
      mechanical general-purpose computer, 
      the Analytical Engine.</div>
    <div class="second-div"> As a child Lovelace was fascinated by machines and mathmatics, 
      and was tutored on these subjects by Mary Somerville, a Scottish scientist and mathematician. 
      <div class="inner-div">Ada Lovelace was born as, 
        Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815 in London, England, 
        to the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke. 
        However, her father left the family when she was just a few weeks old,
        and she was raised by her mother who was determined that Ada 
        would not inherit her father's temperament or poetic tendencies.</div>
      
    </div> In 1833, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor who had
    desgined a machine called the Analytical Engine, which was designed to preform 
    complex calculations automatically. Lovelace was fascinated by the machine 
    and began working with Babbage to refine and develop it. 
  </div> Ada lovelsce is widely considered to be the world's first computer programmer. 
  Her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer designed 
  in the 19th century, was groundbreaking and visionary, and her notes and ideas played 
  an important role in the development of modern computing.
