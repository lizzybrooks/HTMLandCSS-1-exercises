      Yesterday, I saw you smile at the sun. 
      Oh, my fragile heart couldnt bear the sight. 
      One glance and suddenly, I am undone. 
      I wonder, have you tasted loves true plight? 
      
      At first, I thought you were repulsed. 
      How shunned I felt when you glared—wed been paired! 
      Slowly, your glares were warm, should I trust it? 
      I confess I was quickly impaired.
      
      Your soft brown eyes and undivided care, 
      None of which can be compared in this Dunya!* 
      I pray that you will feel Jannahs* cool air, 
      Your blessed smile proves the beauty of its Sunnah.* 
      
      Alas, you are faux—-such a man ceases to exist. 
      I live in this Dunya, dreaming of our tryst.
