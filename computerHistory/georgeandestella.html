        <p>Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist, is known for his groundbreaking work in computer science and artificial intelligence. One of his most significant contributions was the development of the concept of a "universal machine" or a "Turing machine" in 1936. The universal machine was a theoretical device that could perform any computation that could be done by a mechanical computer, and it laid the groundwork for the development of modern computers. Turing's insight was to realize that a machine could be designed that would be capable of performing any computation that could be described by a set of rules, which he called a "program." This idea was revolutionary, and it allowed computers to be programmed to perform a wide range of tasks, paving the way for the development of modern computing as we know it today.</p>
